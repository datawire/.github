# Welcome to Blackbird  

[Blackbird](https://www.getambassador.io/products/blackbird/api-development) is an [API development](https://www.getambassador.io/blog/api-development-comprehensive-guide) platform designed to help developers design, build, test, and manage APIs efficiently with AI-powered code gen, mocking in minutes, and prod-like test environments.

## With Blackbird you can:

### Design APIs instantly
Generate OpenAPI-standardized specs in seconds. Fix your specs from within Blackbird. Start coding immediately without spending an entire sprint on API design.

### Mock APIs in minutes

### Debug seamlessly
Set breakpoints and debug directly from your preferred IDE with Blackbird's integrated debugging tools.
